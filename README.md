# Tea-Maker-3000

Understandably this might be a hard project to verify as it relies heavily on hardware components set up specificaly. Perhaps I might find some sort of program that simulates the hardware layout of an arduino script for learning. 

This project details a Tea Maker I made for the fun of it!
